# Continuous Integration

[Continuous integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) (CI)
is the practice of merging all developers' working copies to a shared mainline several times a day.

scikit-learn implement [different strategies](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/contributing.html#continuous-integration-ci) of Continuous Integration
- Azure pipelines are used for testing scikit-learn on Linux, Mac and Windows, with different dependencies and settings.
- CircleCI is used to build the docs for viewing, for linting with flake8, and for testing with PyPy on Linux

## Lint checks

In both cases a preliminary [linting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)) check is applied: if the lint fails,
build checks are not performed, in order to economise computing resources.

the reasons of the failure.

The log file tells you where the lint issues are.
To locally check the code that you changed, you can run the following command:
``
git diff upstream/master -u -- "*.py" | flake8 --diff
``
