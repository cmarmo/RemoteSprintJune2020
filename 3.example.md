# Run a scikit-learn example
`plot_permutation_importance.py`

## from the command line
```
$ cd scikit-learn
$ ls examples
$ ls examples/inspection
$ python examples/inspection/plot_permutation_importance.py
```

Hint: at any moment use the `pwd` command to find where you are. `pwd` stands
for "Path to Working Directory". For instance here is a typical output one
would get on a Linux machine:

```
$ pwd
/home/ogrisel/code/scikit-learn
```

## from VScode
`ctrl-p` "plot permutation importance" then
`Ctrl-Shift-P` "Run Current File in Python Interactive Window"
